Apparently Dracula had two go-to guys, Hector and Isaac. These Generals in Dracula’s army are Devil Forgemasters, which means they pal around with familiars that they can manufacture, then summon and dismiss at will. 
 
The story goes that Hector betrayed Dracula in some way in response to objections about Dracula’s actions, indirectly causing his defeat at the hands of Trevor Belmont. Ashamed at his own betrayal, Hector gives up the trade until Isaac, who remained loyal to Dracula, kills Hector’s girlfriend Rosaly. A furious Hector chases Isaac to the ruins of the castle and the story of this game begins with the playing taking the role of Hector in his quest for vengeance.', avg_score = 6.91209821787668, release = '2005-11-05', cover_picture_cloudinary_id = 'haerpqzwiquwzz0ol1y9';

The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it. Still, it is easy to get started through playable tutorials. 
 
In Widelands, you are the regent of a small clan. You start out with nothing but your headquarters, where all your resources are stored. 
 
In the course of the game, you will build an ever growing settlement. Every member of your clan will do his or her part to produce more resources - wood, food, iron, gold and more - to further this growth. The economic network is complex and different in the three tribes (Barbarians, Imperials, and Atlanteans). 
 
As you are not alone in the world, you will meet other clans sooner or later. Some of them may be friendly and you may eventually trade with them. However, if you want to rule the world, you will have to train soldiers and fight. 
 
Widelands offers a unique style of play. For example, a system of roads plays a central role in your economy: all the goods that are harvested and processed by the tribe must be transported from one building to the next. This is done by carriers, and those carriers always walk along the roads. It is your job to lay out the roads as efficiently as possible. 
 
Another refreshing aspect of the game is the way you command your clan. There is no need to tell every single one of your subjects what to do - that would be impossible, because there can be thousands of them! Instead, all you need to do is order them to build a building somewhere, and the builders will come. Similarly, whenever you want to attack an enemy, just place an order to attack one of their barracks, and your soldiers will march to fight. You''re really a ruler: You delegate in times of war and in times of peace! 
 
Widelands offers single-player mode with different campaigns; the campaigns all tell stories of tribes and their struggle in the Widelands universe! However, settling really starts when you unite with friends over the Internet or LAN to build up new empires together - or to crush each other in the dusts of war. Widelands also offers an Artificial Intelligence to challenge you.

The queen has landed. Wearied from her perilous flight she sheds her wings, burrows into the soft sand and begins to lay. The first children of the nomadic Formica Ereptor must grow quickly if they are to survive. Soon the ants will embark on a vast and treacherous journey through thick jungle and scorching desert. In the end, only one colony will dominate atop the pinnacle of the ancestral mating grounds and secure its place amongst the great empires of the undergrowth. 
 
Empires of the Undergrowth is a real time strategy game based around the world of ants. It features underground tunneling, nest construction and fast-paced battles with insects, arachnids and other ant colonies. We have taken inspiration from classics Dungeon Keeper and Sim Ant, as well as elements of Starcraft 2''s popular ''Desert Strike'' arcade game for colony vs colony combat 
 
The game’s theme is taken directly from nature, and offers a fresh alternative to the usual sci-fi, fantasy and real-war settings for this genre. In the single-player campaign, the player takes control of a unique colony of DNA-harvesting, nomadic ants embarking on a great journey; they must set up temporary nests, gather food, and defeat neighbouring colonies.

The queen has landed. Wearied from her perilous flight she sheds her wings, burrows into the soft sand and begins to lay. The first children of the nomadic Formica Ereptor must grow quickly if they are to survive. Soon the ants will embark on a vast and treacherous journey through thick jungle and scorching desert. In the end, only one colony will dominate atop the pinnacle of the ancestral mating grounds and secure its place amongst the great empires of the undergrowth. 
 
Empires of the Undergrowth is a real time strategy game based around the world of ants. It features underground tunneling, nest construction and fast-paced battles with insects, arachnids and other ant colonies. We have taken inspiration from classics Dungeon Keeper and Sim Ant, as well as elements of Starcraft 2''s popular ''Desert Strike'' arcade game for colony vs colony combat

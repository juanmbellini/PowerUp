    "summary": "Project Phoenix is a Japanese RPG combined with a squad-based Real Time Strategy game created by a team of talented Eastern and Western developers and artists who have worked on many blockbuster videogame titles. The team we have brought together has allowed us to fuse together Japanese artistic aesthetics and Western design functionality. As a result, we are better able to draw inspiration from the best of both worlds, bringing a richer, more immersive gameplay experience worthy of JRPG fans like you!\n\nIn essence, Project Phoenix breaks new ground in many ways, including:\n\nBeing Kickstarter’s FIRST Japan-based video game project!\nBringing together top-notch talent, combining Eastern AND Western developers with TONS of AAA experience!\nBeing Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu’s FIRST indie game project EVER!\nHaving art that balances Western functionality with Japanese aesthetics!\nBeing a JRPG developed by JRPG veterans!\nCurrently, the game’s planned release date is set for June 2015 and will be available for PC, iOS, and Android mobile devices. More details will be forthcoming, but in the meantime, if you would like to be a part of our vision, you can still back this project using PayPal. Let us lead the way and show how our vision can bring about a rebirth in the JRPG genre!",
    "storyline": "The world is changing…\n\nThe orcish clans, mankind’s ancient enemy, have begun migrating from the mountains and their raids upon human settlements become more brazen and audacious by the day. If this wasn’t enough, the denizens of the southern coastal regions hear rumor of the free men who, once vanquished, have emerged, more organized than before, all with the goal of toppling the Empire. Amidst the stirrings of war, the elves watch a fateful star and recognize it as a portent that will decide the fate of all those who live in Azuregard.\n\nIt is within these tumultumous times that the troubled Templar Marcus Stern encounters Ruffles, an angel stricken with amnesia. Together with the Elven Pathfinder, Sylrianah, reserved but curious to see the world beyond the forest, and Zarum the Lost, a battlemage with his own internal conflicts, they form an unlikely bond. These four heroes must discover their place in a world brought to war by misunderstanding and ignorance, and perhaps ultimately even save it from itself.",

The locations include castles, churches, asylums, and graveyards. The locations will be open-ended so you get to choose your path through each area. But there are risks to exploring to much.\n\nThe game will focus on stealth and exploration. Instead of getting directly attacked, ghosts will stalk and harass you as you investigate locations. You will have to find ways to avoid or trap them while managing your stress as they attempt to scare you to death. You will have upgradable tools and abilities to use as you progress in the game to help you search and survive.",

    "summary": "\"Kologeon is a dark mystic action adventure set in a procedurally generated handcrafted realm tormented by demons and spirits.\n\nYou are an immortal soul that can traverse dimensions outside of physical bodies, fighting for centuries as you establish permanent monuments to mark your journey.\n\nKologeon builds around the ideas of an unfolding experience, freedom of exploration, and self-discovery where quests and guides are not present letting you craft your own journey.\n\nWith procedural generation we aim to create un-repetitive experiences where death is still a setback but won't mean that you'll have to memorize levels and replay the same thing over again. However this isn't a roguelike. Your actions and progress stay permanent.\n\n\n- Explore and interact with a world built on top of itself, coexisting with another.\n\n- Uncover the story through a gloomy dark atmosphere, interaction with spirits, and events you witness or cause. Every place and - feature of the game is carefully crafted with a consideration of the bigger story. We want to create something deep that you could really lose yourself inside of.\n\n- Fly, roll, and rip through demons with a fast satisfying mobility based combat involving astral projection, giant spiritual weapons, time disruption, possession and manipulation of souls. Forge weapons from your enemies and manifest their abilities.\n\n- Enemies are able to dodge, parry, and tear you to pieces as the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master.\"",

They behave like you and only do the things you do. So the way you play the game shapes your enemy. If you run, soon the Echoes will get faster. If you sneak, they will get stealthier. If you shoot, they will start to shoot back. The game constantly reacts to your every choice and input.\n\nThe Palace \"reboots\" every few minutes, resulting in a blackout. This blackout-cycle is the rhythm at which the \"Echoes\" get updated with your latest behavior, learning and unlearning from your actions. During the blackout the palace is blind, giving you the freedom to act without consequence. This is the time to run and gun and do all the things you don’t want the Echoes to learn.\n\nThe experience is one of being up against your own choices from the last blackout-cycle, giving you a way of shaping the game from cycle to cycle. It is up to you whether you prefer to keep a low profile or if you choose to go head on and deal with the consequences later – one thing is certain you need to keep your wits about you as you face the ultimate enemy: Yourself.",

His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

    "summary": "Space Hulk: Deathwing is a First-Person Shooter experience of Games Workshop's classic Space Hulk boardgame set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000, developed on Unreal Engine 4 by Streum On Studio, the team behind E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. Published by Focus Home Interactive and co-produced by Cyanide Studio, Space Hulk: Deathwing offers players the chance to experience a desperate battle against Genestealers in the claustrophobic tunnels of a Space Hulk, as they will gain skills, new abilities and new equipment thanks to experience earned during perilous missions. \n\nSpace Hulks drift along the currents of the Warp, the immaterial dimension of Chaos. Made up of gigantic mangled asteroids, derelict ship wrecks and other spatial debris, they sometimes grow to the size of a moon and often contain treasured and ancient lost technologies. However, they are ripe with danger including infestations of the lethal Genestealers. \n\nPlayers take on the role of a Space Marine from one of the most secret and most feared Space Marine Companies: the Deathwing from the Dark Angels. Strap on your Terminator armour and equip the emblematic weaponry of the Space Marines to overcome the threats awaiting you in the Space Hulk. As a Librarian, you will also master the destructive powers of the Psykers. Your skills and performance in battle grant you Fervor Points, to spend on 4 skill trees allowing you to improve your abilities, unlock new powers, access powerful relics and devastating new weapons.",
    "storyline": "\"A colossal mass of derelict ships, asteroids and debris, known as a Space Hulk, has spilled from the Warp. It’s entered into a system where the Imperium is already beset by a Tyranid hive swarm - the immense Space Hulk is dubbed ‘Olethros’. \n\nThe Dark Angels Chapter of the Space Marines answer the astropathic emergency calls from beleaguered worlds in the system. However, it’s a more important quest that ultimately draws the Dark Angels to the warzone.\n\nAzrael - Supreme Grand Master of the Dark Angels - receives dire premonitions from his psychic Librarians and dispatches a strike fleet to Olethros. Belial – Grandmaster of Dark Angels’ 1st Company, the Deathwing – is charged with boarding the Space Hulk.\n\nAzrael’s psykers believe the strange visions emanating from Olethros foretell disaster. Not only this, but they seem intrinsically linked with the distant past of the Dark Angels chapter.\n\nYou are the Librarian who has been chosen to enter the Genestealer-infested Space Hulk with your squad. In Space Hulk: Deathwing, you’ll venture deep into Olethros in order to uncover the dark secrets within…\"",

    "summary": "Vampyr is set in early 20th century Britain as the country is gripped by the lethal Spanish flu and the streets of London are crippled by disease, violence and fear. In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.\n\nExplore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...\n\nBe careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you \"alive\"; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.\n\nThere will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the \"energy\" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.\n\nVampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.\n\nAs you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.",

It’s also not about the Police being mere cannon fodder as is the case with just about all games on the market. It’s about being an effective Police Officer in a City like most cities around the World. It’s about doing things the right way. It’s about showing how difficult it is but also how rewarding it is to be a good Police Officer.\n\nWe want to continue to honor the work Police Officers do. This game brings with it the opportunity to feel what it’s like and to experience what Police experience. Our mission is to show Police for what we believe they are; real people doing a real job. On that Journey there will also be massive highs for our players to really enjoy the experience.\n\nWhen ever you ask a Police Officer about their job, they say “I love what I do, I love being a Police officer”. This game needs to have the same effect. We want Police fans to LOVE jumping into their patrol car and to experience a whole new open world whilst waiting for thousands of random events to pop up at a moment’s notice.",

The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.\n\n\"Fitted with an advanced CREO exo-suit, balancing your core power against your implants and exo-suit upgrades will allow you to specialize in a huge variety of combat styles, thanks to the almost limitless combinations of addons and dozens of make-shift weapons salvaged from the industrial complex. Finely tune your gear to match your playstyle, and to best suit the challenge ahead. The Metroidvanian levels open up as your core power increases, allowing you to over-charge doors previously too strong for your suit to damage and opening new pathways for you to explore. The CREO facility is vast, and if you want to find and craft the best equipment and weapons, you will need to search every area for secrets and hidden items.\n\nThe Surge features innovative combat mechanics, allowing you to target individual limbs and dismember the exo-suit add-on or weapon you want to acquire. Collecting tech-scrap and blueprints, you will be able to return to the Operation Center to level up and craft new exo-suit addons and weapons salvaged throughout the level. The most powerful of these can be acquired from the world’s gigantic, industrial bosses. Most of what you encounter in The Surge was never originally designed to kill you, and most of the items you loot and craft were never meant for combat. However, the combined strength of the exo-suit and near-future technology of CREO mean that anything from fork-lifting addons to laser cutters can be used as lethal weapons for diving deeper into the facility.\"",

    "storyline": "\"It is the year 518, before the Convocation. The rebellion of the four royal houses against the crown of Nortander instigated by a renegade mage has been quashed by the Queen with the help of a loyal house, but it was a Pyrrhic victory; the war has devastated the country and public order has broken down in many regions, where the law of the strongest now reigns. As if that wasn’t enough, the Queen was seriously injured in the last battle of the war and has been lying in a coma ever since, so the supreme commander of the royal forces is now in charge of state affairs either until she awakens or dies, in which case her niece will step up as her successor. The Lord Marshal rules with an iron fist in his attempt to restore stability to the country and has, among other things, used magic, which is prohibited in Nortander unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nBut there is a glimmer of light in these dark times. There are growing signs that Aonir, the Godfather, has returned to Eo. Increasing numbers of people are looking to Aonir as the only God, and pray he will lead Nortander to another golden age.\n\nAlthough your father was one of the rebel mages, as a member of the royal army you have remained loyal to the Queen. Will you uphold your responsibilities toward Nortander?\"",

    "storyline": "Keeper and the Soldier is about a little girl named Emi, who is born into a world consumed by centuries of war and conflict. Everyone is given a job at birth, and job Emi’s will be to become a soldier. But Emi is curious and likes to explore the city where she lives, including where she is not allowed to go. She meets a mysterious creature called The Keeper, a relic from the past with a vast amount of knowledge as to what life was like before the war. This is fascinating to Emi, the Keeper is like nothing she has ever seen before. Emi and the Keeper go on a journey to rediscover the lost history of the world. On the way they find the most dangerous thing of all. The Truth.\n\nThis game stemmed from a personal project that our project lead started in 2009, which was a collection of characters, story, and artwork relating to her efforts in making sense of and coming to terms with her experiences with child abuse. Keeper and the Soldier uses symbolism and fantasy to the tales of a young girl's struggles; inspired by real ordeals.\n\nOur team is a strong supporter against child abuse and neglect, and we hope to contribute to and plan future charitable/awareness events towards this cause.",

    "summary": "\"No Place for Bravery is an atmospheric minimalist roguelike where you play as a group of adventurers wandering through an eerie, devastated high fantasy world on a quest to slay the godlike entities that brought down humankind. \n\nIt is basically an action RPG with super neat, Hyper Light Drifter inspired pixel art, minimalist controls, procedurally generated maps and a time manipulation mechanic similar to Super Time Force's that lets the player control more than one character simultaneously by playing with one character and then rewinding time and playing with another character alongside the first one: not only the player has to plan every move, he also has to synchronize everything. \n\nBravery is, like many other roguelikes, filled with unique random events. The idea is to use these events to craft the game’s mythology. The game doesn't use regular exposition to tell it's story, rather, the player will absorb the nuances of Bravery’s narrative by exploring its gorgeous environment, experiencing the aesthetics of its mechanics or by simply making sense of the vast array of mysterious random events. \n\nAlso, the game gets rid of all the grinding: Skinner Box mechanics and ''artificial'' stats-based progression have no place here: I'm talking about a game with absolutely no numbers and very, very few written words. \n\nNo Place for Bravery is an extremely hard and completely skill and strategy based game. The world is to be relentless, and the player feels the mediocrity before such a world in each step that is taken.\"",

    "storyline": "The game will put players in the shoes of Mark, a young adult drifting through life. Bored of his dead end job and feeling less risk averse than usual, Mark decides to take a leap of faith and joins his friends on a cross-country Ekosi tour.\n\nEkosi is the name of the card game used as the battle system for Luckless Seven. The foundation for the card game was inspired by Pazaak, a minigame from Bioware’s 2003 hit Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Both Ekosi and Pazaak are similar to Blackjack but have a few key differences such as players having a hand in which they can play cards to manipulate their score.\n\nBesides battling other characters, players will travel with a group of Mark’s childhood friends. Each of the characters that travels with Mark will have a prominent role in the story and fully developed character arcs. The player’s interactions with his party members and other characters in the story will determine what dialogue choices they can make and how their story will conclude.\n\nThe game will have a top-down isometric view and feature an overworld that the player can explore. Numerous NPCs scattered throughout the world will engage the player in Ekosi battles. Players will unlock new cards and additional quests by taking the time to explore the world and challenge other characters. The player will also have numerous interactions with their party throughout each stage of their journey.\n\nThe players will have more options and strategies available to them as they win more cards. Besides collecting powerful cards, the player will also be able to interact with many NPCs and witness many story-creating events when they explore Arithia’s cities. By taking the time to interact with the world’s characters and participating in each party member’s story arcs, the player will level up their character and unlock additional story events, dialogue trees, and endings.",

    "summary": "Potions: A Curious Tale is an adventure-crafting game where your wits are your greatest weapons and combat is not always the answer. Encounter fairy tale characters and stories from around the world as you play as Luna, a young witch who overcomes obstacles with the potions she brews.\n\n------\n\nGrowing up is hard, and it’s even harder when you’re a witch! As Luna, you’ll solve devious puzzles and battle monsters with your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right) and Helios, your sharp-tongued cat familiar, you’ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales – often with an unexpected twist! \n\nAs powerful as your potions are, you’ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You’ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger. Manage your resources carefully, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs most.\n\nFeatures:\n- Conflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat—calm, charm, tame, and scare your enemies\n- Strategic combat—use potions, the environment, and even other monsters to defeat your foes\n- Quirky storyline featuring rich characters from folklore from around the world—all with a unique spin\n- Crafting system that rewards experimentation\n- Countless environments to explore as you search for rare ingredients\n- Resource management that rewards a varied play style, with a vast number of potions and ingredients\n- Luna, your resident witch-in-training and strong female lead\nBeautiful illustrated art style reminiscent of your favorite storybooks and animated tales",
